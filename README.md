# Adding food items

To add a food item, open up the acid_reflux_repo.json file and add entries like the ones listed below.

Supported food items use the following format:

    {
        "id": "100"
        "name": "Tomato",
        "reflux": "avoid",
        "category": "Fruits and vegetables"
    }

* **id** - id for item. Has to be unique within the .json file (cannot have been used for another item)
* **name** - plaintext name of the food item, include serving max in brackets
* **reflux** - reflux classification of the item. Currently only "avoid", "remedy" and "ok" are supported
* **category** - food category this item belongs to. Please use an existing category

Notes:

* If you are new to JSON, please note that all food items except the last item must have a comma after the closing }
